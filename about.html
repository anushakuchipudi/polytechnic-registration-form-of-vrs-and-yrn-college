  A premier educational institution in Andhra Pradesh is known for excellence and service. The three sentences (udyate namah, udayate namah and uditaaya namah) that appear on the emblem alert the student to the fact that education is a three fold achievement passing through three phases: Even as the Sun goes through dawn to the noon, rising from below the nadir to the zenith, the student must first be intent on learning, then work persistently, and attain the full bloom of his latent skills. He should also, like the Sun, be selfless in working the world into its full potential attainment.

Vutukuri Ramayya Sreshti & Yarlagadda Ranganayakulu Naidu College, Chirala, was started as VRS College in 1951 with the munificence of Sri Vutukuri Ramayya Sreshti, to cater to the educational needs of backward and deprived rural sections of the then Guntur District of Madras State. VRS College has been rechristened as VRS & YRN College since 1962 after the donation of an eminent philanthropist Sri Yarlagadda Ranganayakulu Naidu through his charitable trust for the development of the College. The College possesses a sprawling campus of 108 acres of land in picturesque surroundings and serene atmosphere on Chirala â€“ Vadarevu Road (About 3 km from the shore of Bay of Bengal). The College has witnessed phenomenal growth in its infrastructure and other facilities during the last 64 years. The college has witnessed the golden era during the leadership of Dr. Solasa Satyanarayana as President of the College, Sri Jagarlamudi Sivaram Prasad as Secretary & Correspondent and Sri Polavarapu Jagadeeswara Rao as Principal. Having setup impressive infrastructural facilities and possessing visionary Management, dynamic Principals, committed faculty members and dedicated supporting staff, the College has reached a stage of consolidation and is poised for a qualitative growth in academic research, extracurricular, innovations, community and industry interactions, which will enable it to become a centre of excellence in higher education.

In 2018 yalamanchili has adopted vrs and yrn college of engineering and technology and it is providing free education for hundreds of students and it is also providing oppurtunities for students.
